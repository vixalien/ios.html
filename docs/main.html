		iOS.html is a reproduction of <a href="https://www.developer.com/design/human-design-interface/ios">iOS Human Design Interface</a> in HTML, so that we can use it in our webapps.
	</p>
	<p>
		We all like the appearance of iOS, no, so this is what I tried: I made an HTML project, call it a boilerplate, so that we can design webapps with the appearance of iOS

	<h4>The journey is still long</h4>
	<p>
		As this was a personal initiative, I tried to do what I can, but day by day I get exhausted, because there are very few contributors and no donations, It's then that I ask myself, why am I making this, if nobody even know about It.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am currently thinking about dropping this down about: April 2020, unless there are some miraculous actions happening. By the way, thanks.
