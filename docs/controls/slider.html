		A slider is a horizontal track with a control called a thumb, which you can slide with your finger to move between a minimum and maximum value, such as screen brightness level or position during media playback. As a slider's value changes, the portion of track between the minimum value and the thumb fills with color. A slider can optionally display left and right icons that illustrate the meaning of the minimum and maximum values.
